Yfinance is an open source library developed by Ran Aroussi for accessing Yahoo Finance’s financial data

!pip install yfinance --quiet
!pip install pmdarima --quiet

With the second line “!pip install pmdarima — quiet”, the “pmdarima” library is installed. The AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is used in this library for time series analysis and forecasting

!pip install statsmodels==0.11.0rc1 --quiet
!pip install -Iv pulp==1.6.8 --quiet

“!pip install statsmodels==0.11.0rc1 — quiet” installs the “statsmodels” library version 0.11.0rc1. Statistical modeling and econometrics can be performed using this library in Python.

It installs version 1.6.8 of the “pulp” library with the second line “!pip install -Iv pulp==1.6.8 — quiet”. In Python, this library is used for linear programming optimization. If a newer version of the library is already installed, the “-Iv” option forces the installation of the specified version. Installing this specific version is ensured by the “==1.6.8” notation. During the installation process, “ — quiet” suppresses any output messages generated.

Ex:
	import yfinance as yf

	# getting data from Yahoo Finance
	stock_name = 'AMD'  # here you can change the name of stock ticker, for example we will 	take AMD ticker
	data = yf.download(stock_name, start="2020-03-26", end="2021-03-29")
